    "Ans - Types of Data\n",
    "      Data can be broadly classified into two categories: qualitative and quantitative.\n",
    "\n",
    "      #Qualitative Data\n",
    "      Qualitative data refers to information that is descriptive, subjective, and non-numerical in nature. It is often collected through\n",
    "      surveys, interviews, observations, and focus groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Examples of qualitative data:\n",
    "\n",
    "      - Colors (red, blue, green)\n",
    "      - Textures (smooth, rough, soft) etc\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "      #Quantitative Data\n",
    "      Quantitative data refers to information that is numerical, objective, and measurable. It is often collected through experiments,\n",
    "      surveys, and sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Examples of quantitative data:\n",
    "\n",
    "      - Age (25, 30, 35)\n",
    "      - Height (165 cm, 170 cm, 175 cm)\n",
    "\n",
    "      #Scales of Measurement\n",
    "      Quantitative data can be further classified into four scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "      #Nominal Scale\n",
    "      A nominal scale is a labeling scale that categorizes data into distinct groups without any inherent order or hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Examples of nominal scales:\n",
    "\n",
    "     - Colors (red, blue, green)\n",
    "     - Categories (male, female, other)\n",
    "\n",
    "      #Ordinal Scale\n",
    "      An ordinal scale is a ranking scale that categorizes data into distinct groups with a natural order or hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Examples of ordinal scales:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Education level (high school, college, graduate)\n",
    "        - Income level (low, medium, high)\n",
    "        - Satisfaction rating (unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied)\n",
    "\n",
    "      #Interval Scale\n",
    "      An interval scale is a numerical scale that measures data with equal intervals between consecutive levels, but without a true zero point.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Examples of interval scales:\n",

    "        - Temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit)\n",

    "Q2 -  What are the measures of central tendency, and when should you use each? Discuss the mean, median,\n",
    "      and mode with examples and situations where each is appropriate.\n",
    "Ans - Measures of central tendency are statistical tools that help us understand the central or typical value of a dataset. The three\n",
    "      main measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which\n",
    "      to use depends on the nature of the data and the research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "      1. Mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "        The mean, also known as the arithmetic mean, is the average value of a dataset. It's calculated by summing up all the values\n",

    "\n",
    "       When to use the mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The data is normally distributed (symmetric and bell-shaped).\n",
    "        - The data doesn't have extreme outliers.\n",
    "        - You want to include every value in the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "      2. Median:\n",
    "\n",
    "         The median is the middle value of a dataset when it's sorted in order. If there's an even number of values, the median is\n",
    "         the average of the two middle values.\n",

    "\n",
    "         When to use the median:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "         Example: Find the mode of the following exam scores: 70, 80, 90, 70, 85\n",
    "\n",
    "         Mode = 70 (since it appears twice, more than any other value)\n",
    "\n",
    "         When to use the mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - The data is categorical (nominal data).\n",

    "Q3  - Explain the concept of dispersion. How do variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data?\n",

    "\n",
    "      Variance:\n",
    "      Variance measures the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. It's calculated as the sum of \n",
